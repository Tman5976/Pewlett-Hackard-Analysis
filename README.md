# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Project Overview

This challenge tested our knowledge of creating and manipulating tables in SQL. Our assignment centered on examining employee data for a company to determine how many employees are nearing retirement.

## Results

- This company has a significant number of employees nearing retirement age. The unique_titles table shows there are well over 10,000 employees who were born between 1952 and 1955.

- Senior Engineers and Senior Staff will most likely make up the majority of positions seeing employees retire. The image below shows over 50,000 employees with those position titles were in the target age range.

- The same image shows management will see minimal turnover as only two employees are closing in on retirement.

- The employee mentorship program has slightly under 2,000 eligible employees. Many of whom are in the Engineering and Staff departments.

## Summary

The retiring_titles table shows us that the Engineering and Staff departments will see the most turnover. The total number of employees in retirement age is more than 80,000 employees. These departments will need the most attention as the retirements start.

I believe there are enough qualified employees to help the next generation of workers to slide into the position. The mentorship_eligibility table shows that numerous employees from the most affected departments will be able to train the incoming employees.
